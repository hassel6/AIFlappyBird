# AIFlappyBird
Genetic Algorithm implemented Flappy Bird Coding with C++ 

# Description

The game is simple! Just run and watch :)

The game is created with SFML. The main thing is birds have neural network that have 3 layer of neurons and the fittest ones transfer their weights to next generations. Input layer has 3 inputs these are bird's Y level, bird to the closest pipes X level and bird to the closest lower pipe's Y level. The second layer is hidden layer that consists of 7 neurons.
